How To Play:

Move with WASD.
You'll hear that one tone becomes sharper or flatter as you move up and down,
and another tone becomes sharper or flatter as you move left and right.
There is one position that sounds harmonious with the background music.
Stand there for a few seconds and you'll move on to the next level.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
