# Harmonia

Author: Russell Emerine

Design: Harmonia is a game where you control two tones with your position.
The goal is to make the tones harmonious with the background movement.

How To Play:

Move with WASD.
You'll hear that one tone becomes sharper or flatter as you move up and down,
and another tone becomes sharper or flatter as you move left and right.
There is one position that sounds harmonious with the background music.
Stand there for a few seconds and you'll move on to the next level.
